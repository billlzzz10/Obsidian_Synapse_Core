# Agent Work Report: Blink Note Project Scaffolding

## 1. Objective

The primary objective was to create the complete file and directory structure for the "Blink Note" Obsidian plugin, as specified in the `Overview.md` and `Overview-2.md` documents. A mid-project user request also required the integration of a new tool, `Context7`.

## 2. Work Summary

I successfully executed the plan, which involved the following key phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Project Scaffolding

- **Directory Structure:** Created the complete, nested directory structure for the project root and the `src` folder, including directories for `agents`, `services`, `tools`, `types`, `ui`, and `settings`.
- **Configuration:** Generated all necessary configuration files:
    - `.gitignore` (standard Node.js template)
    - `manifest.json` (from overview)
    - `package.json` (with `svelte`, `typescript`, `vitest` dependencies)
    - `tsconfig.json`
    - `.eslintrc.cjs`
    - `vitest.config.ts`
- **Core Files:** Created the initial core source files:
    - `README.md` (from overview)
    - `src/main.ts`
    - `src/services/EventBus.ts`
- **UI Components:** Created all Svelte UI components as specified in the design documents:
    - `BlinkNoteView.svelte` (main view)
    - `CommandBar.svelte`
    - `PlanningCard.svelte`
    - `ExecutionCard.svelte`
    - `SyncStatus.svelte`
    - `icons/MagicWandIcon.svelte`
- **Placeholder Files:** To complete the architecture, I created placeholder `.ts` files for all remaining classes and types, ensuring the project is ready for future development. This included all agents, services, tool providers, and type definitions mentioned in the specifications.

### Phase 2: Integration of Context7

In response to a user request, I integrated the `Context7` tool into the project architecture.

- **`Context7Provider.ts`:** Created a new tool provider at `src/tools/providers/Context7Provider.ts`. This provider includes a mock implementation for the `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` tools, matching the functionality described by the user.
- **`main.ts` Integration:** Updated `main.ts` to demonstrate how the `Context7Provider` would be registered with the `ToolRegistry` upon application startup. This conceptually wires the new tool into the agent system.
- **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` with a new section, "Enhanced by Context7," to inform developers and users of this powerful new capability.

## 3. Final Status

The `blink-note-obsidian` directory now contains a complete and accurate scaffolding of the entire project as envisioned in the planning documents, including the successful integration of the user-requested `Context7` tool. The project is now in a state where development on the internal logic of each component can begin.

## 4. Review and Recommendations

### Review
The overall architecture is robust, modular, and highly extensible, which is excellent for a project of this nature. The separation of concerns between agents, tools, and services is clear. The spontaneous addition of the `Context7Provider` was handled smoothly and fits perfectly into the existing provider model, demonstrating the architecture's flexibility.

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1.  **Implement Core Tool Logic:** The immediate next step should be to implement the actual logic for the core tool providers. Start with `FilesystemProvider.ts` and write the Node.js code for finding, reading, and writing files within the Obsidian vault.
2.  **Flesh out the `ToolRegistry`:** Implement the `register` and `execute` methods in `ToolRegistry.ts` to make it a functional dispatcher.
3.  **Write Unit Tests:** Begin writing unit tests using the pre-configured `vitest` framework. Good candidates to start with are `EventBus.ts` and the mock implementation of `Context7Provider.ts`.
4.  **Connect UI to Services:** Wire up the Svelte components to the `EventBus`. The `CommandBar` should publish a `User.Command` event, and the `PlanningCard` and `ExecutionCard` should subscribe to `Plan.Created` and `Exec.Update` events, respectively.
5.  **LLM Integration:** The most significant next step will be integrating a real Large Language Model (LLM) client into the `PlannerAgent` to replace the current mock/placeholder logic.
